As we mentioned in class, recurrent and bidirectional recurrent neural networks, of which LSTMs are the most common examples, can be used to perform sequence labeling. Although these models encode information from the surrounding words in order to make predictions, there are no \"hard\" constraints on what tags can appear where.\n","\n","There hard constraints are particularly important for tasks that label spans of more than one token. The most common example of a span-labeling task is named-entity recognition (NER). As described in Eisenstein, Jurafksy & Martin, and other texts, the goal of NER is to label spans of one or more words as _mentions_ of an _entity_, such as a person, location, organization, etc.\n","\n","The most common approach to NER is to reduce it to a sequence-labeling task, where each token in the input is labeled either with an `O`, if it is \"outside\" any named-entity span, or with `B-TYPE`, if it is the first token in an entity of type `TYPE`, or with `I-TYPE`, if it is the second or later token in an entity of type `TYPE`. Distinguishing between the first and later tokens of an entity allow us to identify distinct entity spans even when they are adjacent.\n","\n","Common values of `TYPE` include `PER` for person, `LOC` for location, `DATE` for date, and so on. In the dataset we load below, there are 17 distinct types.\n","\n","The span-labeling scheme just described implies that the labels on tokens must obey certain constraints: the tag `I-PER` must follow either `B-PER` or another `I-PER`. It cannot follow `O`, `B-LOC`, or `I-LOC`, i.e., a tag for a different entity type. By themselves, LSTMs or bidirectional LSTMs cannot directly enforce these constraints. This is one reason why conditional random fields (CRFs), which _can_ enforce these constraints, are often layered on top of these recurrent models.\n","\n","In this assignment, you will implement the simplest possible CRF: a CRF so simple that it does not require any training. Rather, it will assign weight 1 to any sequence of tags that obeys the constraints and weight 0 to any sequence of tags that violates them. The inputs to the CRF, which are analogous to the emission probabilities in an HMM, will come from an LSTM.\n","\n","But first, in order to test your decoder, you will also implement some functions to evaluate the output of an NER system according to two metrics:\n","1. You will count the number of _violations_ of the NER label constraints, i.e., how many times `I-TYPE` follows `O` or a tag of a different type or occurs at the beginning of a sentence. This number will be greater than 0 in the raw LSTM output, but should be 0 for your CRF output.\n","1. You will compute the _span-level_ precision, recall, and F1 of NER output. Although the baseline LSTM was trained to achieve high _token-level_ accuracy, this metric can be misleadingly high, since so many tokens are correctly labeled `O`. In other words, what proportion of spans predicted by the model line up exactly with spans in the gold standard, and what proportion of spans in the gold standard were predicted by the model? Define _span_ as a sequence of tags that starts with a `B-TYPE` followed by zero or more `I-TYPE` tags. Sequences solely of `I-TYPE` tags don't count as spans.For more, see the original task definition: https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W03-0419/.\n","\n","We start with loading some code and data and the
